   <h3> Soccer</h3>
   <p id='pSport'> I used play soccer when I was younger for Tramore Athletic Football Club
        but when I was in secondary school I gave it up. I usually played striker but I
        was a centre back before that. I've supported Manchester United my whole life 
        and try to watch as many of their games as I can, which is often made difficult 
        since I don't have the channels.

   <h3>Rugby</h3>
   <p id='pSport'>
       I used play rugby but only for a couple of months because I found 
       I didn't enjoy playing it. I still watch rugby when Ireland play and 
       the odd time when Munster play. I went to the six nations match Ireland vs
       Italy in the Aviva Stadium in 2016 when Ireland thrashed Italy 58-15.

   <h3>Athletics</h3>
   <p id='pSport'>
      I used do athletics with Leevale Running Club, I did mostly running,
      long distance and sprints. I also enjoy watching Athletics during a big 
      event such as the Olympics because it's unbelievable to watch how 
      fast and durable some of the athletes are at the top level.
